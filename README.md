# User-Behavior-Analysis
<b>In this project we will discuss on: </b><div>
    <ol>
 <li>How do consumers get to the point of purchase</li>
 <li>How many people actually get to this point?</li>
 <li>How many people get stuck in earlier stages?</li>
      <li>Which stages are we talking about?</li>
</ol>
Then we'll look at the results of an A/A/B test to see if altering the font throughout the app makes users feel intimidated by the new design.
